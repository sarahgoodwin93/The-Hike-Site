# [The Hike Site](https://sarahgoodwin93.github.io/The-Hike-Site/ "Link to The Hike Site Webpage")

The Hike Site is by hikers for hikers. A place people can come to in order to get information for their hiking trip to Scotland. Could be a day hike or a multi-day wild camping trip, The Hike Site has helpful tips and tricks to make your adventure the best it can be.

The site will target people who are wanting to come to Scotland for a hiking trip and give information about different suggested walks, gear they could take, a checklist and a chance to sign up to a group walk.

The idea of the site comes from a need to combine walking suggestion sites, gear sites and house a checklist, all in the one place, to allow users to come to a one-stop-shop for their trip.
